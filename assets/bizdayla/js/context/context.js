Throughout history technology has been and will always be one of, if not the most important part of the equation when it comes to advancing ones vision and mission.  With that being said Business Owners have to accept the fact that technology is going to continue to disrupt business per usual.  There seems to be only a few options for a Business Owner who might have the foresight to see how technology can be leveraged to directly support their Business Strategy and Goals; and even open up opps that they were not even aware of.  Building a strong and flexible workforce that can be trained up on current trends that are emerging and the application of those technologies can make all the difference.  As Business Owners we have taken on the journey of Life Long Learning, and understanding todays ever changing landscape to make an impact on our customers and making an impact in this realm and needs to be alway a priority."
